# Library

A library made with HTML, CSS and JS, in which you can add, remove books or mark their status as 'Read'/'Not read'.
Working on this project helped me understand how Objects and Object Constructors work. I also learned how to associate DOM elements with their respective objects by giving them data- attributes.

This project was created for the [Library assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) as part of The Odin Project.
